## Description

This project allows users to login and save 

With this project, I was given starter code. Using the starter code I refactored it to use graphql as opposed to restful API.

I used the files within the schema folder to set this up: index.js, resolvers.js, and typeDefs.js. I utilized the given user-controller.js file, models and routes to set up my resolvers. 

On the client side, I added a queries.js and a mutations.js. I also had to update the App.js, and all of the files within the pages and components folders. 

This app is not currently functioning on heroku but should be fixed shortly.
